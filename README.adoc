= BS Information Systems' Final Project at UMC

== Overview
Monolithic application meant to provide nutrition information helping users in balancing their diets with the follow up of real nutritionists, aiming better life quality.

== Stack
- JAVA + Spring
- JSF 1.2 + RichFaces
- PostgreSQL DB

== Requisites
- JDK8 or higher
- Maven
- Docker

== How to test locally

=== Build the executable
In your favorite terminal, at the project root folder execute the command below to build and generate the war package:
[source, bash]
--
mvn clean package
--

=== Start the database
Still at the project root folder, run the following to download the database image and start it via Docker:
[source, bash]
--
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-postgres up
--

=== Database initial setup
The first time you start Postgresql DB, only the schema is created automatically, so that it's required to create tables and indexes, as well as populate them with initial data for the application to work as desired in the next steps.

==== DB Connection
Connect to the database with the following credentials on a SQL client of choice, for instance DBeaver or Squirrel, or even via command line.

* Host: localhost
* Port: 5432
* User: postgres
* Password: aula

==== DDL
Load the script located at `help/scripts/ddl.sql` to generate tables and another necessary resources.

==== DML
Load initial data via contents from the script `help/scripts/initial_data.sql`.

=== Start the application server
Now it's time to start Payara to deploy the war generated at the _build_ step.
[source, bash]
--
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-payara up
--

=== Validate the application
In your favorite browser verify that you can access the application at http://localhost:8080/nutribem-v1.

Expected result:
